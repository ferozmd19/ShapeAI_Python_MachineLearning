#SHAPEAI PYTHON AND MACHINE LEARNING BOOTCAMP
Hi, I made this project during the 7 days free boot camp conducted by <b> SHAPEAI
</b>.
 The instructor during the session was Mr Shaurya Sinha(Data Analyst Interm at jio). I got
 to
 learn a lot during the 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with SHAPEAI.
<br><br>Here’s the link for you to watch the sessions as well<br>

<br>  I  have hands on experience on:
<> python
<> machine learning
<> tense or flow
<br> during the 7 days, and everything was explained from the very basic so that anyone with zero experience on programming can learn .
I enjoyed these 7days, you can as well. To register for next free 7 days boot camp,visit:
